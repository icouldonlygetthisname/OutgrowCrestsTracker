## Addon Purpose

Display per-slot gear upgrade progress toward the "X of the Dawn" crest discount achievements in Midnight Season 1. These achievements unlock a **50% crest cost discount for alts** (up from 33% in Dragonflight/TWW) and allow uptrading crests to the next tier.

## Mist Achievement Series (Season 2, active)

Feats of Strength added in Patch 12.1.0. These supersede the Dawn series — high
watermarks reset with the season, so only the active season can be evaluated
from live `C_ItemUpgrade` data.

| Achievement            | ID    | Required iLvl | Crest Discount Unlocked         | Uptrade Unlock                          |
|------------------------|-------|---------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

## Dawn Achievement Series (Season 1, legacy)

All are Feats of Strength added in Patch 12.0.1. Each achievement fires when **every equipment slot** reaches the required item level high watermark.

| Achievement            | ID    | Required iLvl | Crest Discount Unlocked         | Uptrade Unlock                          |

## Midnight Upgrade System Changes

- Upgrades cost a small amount of **gold** instead of Valorstones.
- Each upgrade requires **20 crests** of the matching type (e.g., Champion track uses Champion Dawncrests).
- **100 crests** can be earned per week.
- All tracks have **6 equal ranks**, no overlapping between tiers.
- Crest cost increases with each rank along a track.
- The character-specific discount (free upgrades for same-ilvl pieces on the same character) is separate from the alt-wide achievement discount.

- Returns two numbers: character-level watermark and account-level watermark
- Added in 10.1.0, available on 12.0.1+
- **Predicates**: MayReturnNothing, SecretArguments, AllowedWhenUntainted

### C_ItemUpgrade.GetHighWatermarkForItem(itemInfo)

| Offhand              | 16    |                                |

**Note on weapons**: Slots 12-16 cover different weapon configurations. A 2H user only has slot 12 active; dual-wielders use 14+15; sword+shield uses 14+16, etc. The addon needs to handle weapon slot relevance based on class/spec.

## User Macros (Reference)

Champion of the Dawn progress check — prints each slot's watermark, colored by threshold:
```lua
/run local n=tInvert(Enum.ItemRedundancySlot)for i=0,16 do local a=C_ItemUpgrade.GetHighWatermarkForSlot(i)if a and n[i]then print((a>=263 and"\124cffA020F0"or a>=250 and"\124cff0070dd"or"\124cff00ff00")..a.." - "..n[i].."\124r")end end
```

Simpler version checking just Champion (263):
```lua
/run local n=tInvert(Enum.ItemRedundancySlot),a;for i=0,16 do a=C_ItemUpgrade.GetHighWatermarkForSlot(i);local c=(a>=263)and"\124cff00ff00"or"";print(format("%s%d\124r %s",c,a,n[i]))end
```

## Design Notes

- The addon should show which slots are holding back progress toward the next achievement
- Color-code: green for slots meeting threshold, yellow/red for slots below
- Show both character and account watermarks
- Indicate which achievements are already completed
- Weapon slots need special handling — not all 5 weapon slots are relevant for every spec
